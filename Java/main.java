/* but you have to name the file the same as your class or 
java gonna be like "Aye that aint the correct thing, fix it fool!" 

but cool thing about java is that it is something you tell it to do and it will do it.

if i make it do  2 / 4 x 3^4 which i can not do yet but learning but i can do 

something else

by the way, remember to add the import and package because its gonna be needed to work on your project.
without, its just gonna be like "nah we aint executing that bro" so remember
